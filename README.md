3. Last step is to specify secret key or download html. Check below both methods.

**BTT requires secret key for security reason**

WindowManager [hosted](https://btt-window-manager.netlify.com/) on netlify but you don't have a reason to trust someone from open-source, so it will be easier and saver to download html and change the html link in BTT settings.


#### Self-hosted html
1. Download html: [WindowManager.html](WindowManager.html)
2. Change the link to downloaded html path.
